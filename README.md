Microkernel x86-64 (Assembly)

Overview

This project is a minimal microkernel written entirely in x86-64 Assembly, designed for low-level system understanding and experimental kernel engineering.

The architecture follows a true microkernel design, where only essential mechanisms are implemented in kernel space:

- Task scheduling
- Memory management (basic paging model)
- Inter-process communication (IPC)

All other services are intended to run in user space.

Build Requirements

- NASM
- GNU LD
- QEMU
- Linux environment (recommended)

Install dependencies (Debian/Ubuntu):

sudo apt install nasm gcc ld qemu-system-x86

---

Build & Run

Build the system

make

Run in QEMU

make run

Debug mode

make debug

This enables:

- serial output
- CPU state tracing
- GDB stub ("-s -S")

---

Boot Process

1. BIOS loads bootloader at "0x7C00"
2. Bootloader loads kernel into memory ("0x100000")
3. Execution jumps to kernel entry point
4. Kernel initializes:
   - memory
   - scheduler
   - IPC
5. User-space servers are started

---

Key Components

Bootloader

- Loads kernel sectors from disk
- Transfers control to kernel memory

Kernel Core

- Entry point and initialization logic

Scheduler

- Round-robin task switching
- Task Control Block (TCB)

Memory Manager

- Simple page allocator (4KB pages)

IPC

- Message-based communication
- Decouples services from kernel

---

Debugging

Primary methods:

- Serial output (COM1) → reliable for kernel debugging
- QEMU debug flags → CPU/interrupt tracing
- GDB remote debugging

Example:

qemu-system-x86_64 -drive format=raw,file=build/os.img -serial stdio -s -S

---

Known Limitations

- No full paging implementation yet
- No user-mode isolation (ring3 not active)
- No real filesystem
- Limited interrupt handling
- Static memory model

---

Roadmap

- [ ] Protected mode transition
- [ ] Long mode activation
- [ ] Full paging (PML4)
- [ ] System call interface
- [ ] User-mode processes
- [ ] Driver abstraction
- [ ] Filesystem server
- [ ] ELF loader

---
